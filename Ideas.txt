Factory style incremental game
    - Power generation
    - Automation of the production of product
    - Automation of collecting raw resources
    - Managing potential dangers (Overheating, etc.)
    - Multiple factories for producing different products
        - Some products used for making others
        - Some products speed up production of others or increase efficiency
    - Simple day/night system to affect solar generators
    - Buildings/Workers require incur a continuous cash cost
        - Increase worker skill/efficiency

Workers:
    - Salary based on their total level
    - Gain levels in certain work fields
        - Miner, Woodcutter, Factory operator...
    - Levels increase efficiency in the specific field
    - Can be reallocated to a new field - levels wasted, etc.

Unlocks:
    - Unlock access to new land - build new factories
        - New land can also allow for specialised factories based on land features

Starting off:
    - Start off with a few workers and some starting cash
    - Collect raw resources (coal, wood, ore, etc.)
    - Either sell resources raw to earn starting cash
        - Or construct basic processing factories such as refining ores

Progression:
    - Improve power generation
        - Higher efficiency solar
        - Nuclear
        - Hydro/Wind
    - Create more advanced products
        - May require other products
        - Require multiple steps and different types of processing
